# MARTA Split-Flap Display

## About

This is a work-in-progress borne out of my fascination with split-flap mechanisms and my love of trains. I've been riding MARTA, Atlanta's public transit system, for 15+ years and have a deep appreciation for it.

Forked from DavidTropiansky's version for the NYC subway [Subway-Split-Flap-Solari](https://github.com/DavidTropiansky/Subway-Split-Flap-Solari?tab=readme-ov-file) which uses the template from baspete's [Split-Flap](https://github.com/baspete/Split-Flap/) project and incorporates the Python from lightalan's [subwayclock](https://github.com/lightalan/subwayclock) display.
